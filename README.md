# good-citizen
Several activists in India are villified on mainstream media with news anchors showing a caricatured version of them. Fake or decontexualised statements are attributed to them and often they are reduced to just a few tags- "Anti-national", "Sikular", "Libtard" etc.  An Good Citizen is an attempt to make the stories of these activists and their choices relatable. My aim was to make the player put him/herself in the place of the activist and make the same choices that they made. I used Twine to write this interactive fiction game which is still at its initial stages.
